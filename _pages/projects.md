- ## [Event-based Human Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RInzuru4kLc&list=PLmh89C-c5SgkoLWkyx7nXu3Eklc8A-VeU)
    Project on using event camera to do the moving human detection in low-latency (200hz) and high dynamic range fashion.

- ## [Long-term Autonomy of Mobile Robots](https://github.com/codingrex/Long-Term-Autonomy)
    My research project on the intersection of vision and robotics. 
    
    Using semantic understanding from vision to improve the real-robot navigation in a glasswall environment.

- ## [Fundamental SLAM Algorithms](https://github.com/codingrex/SLAM_Course)
    I learned and implemented some fundamental SLAM algorithms based on the Robot Mapping lecture series from Dr. Cyrill Stachniss.
    
    After doing self-learning on the videos and lecture notes, I learned the basics of what is SLAM, how to do (classic paradigms) and why (Derivation). 
    
    The topics including: 
    * Odomotery model and Sensor model
    * Kalman filter family: EFK, UKF 
    * (Rao-Blackwellized) Particle filter 
    * Feature-based mapping and Occupancy grid based mapping 
    * FastSLAM
    * Graph-based SLAM (front-end, back-end)
