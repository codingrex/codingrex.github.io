I am a **PhD student** in the **Computer Science** Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

I am working with Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos and Cornelia Ferm√ºller at [Perception and Robotics Group](https://prg.cs.umd.edu/). 

My research interest is on the **intersection of vision and robotics**, especially on 3D Vision for Robotics.
 
 Besides working at the school, I did a summer internship as a **Robotics Software Engineer** at [Brain Corp](https://www.braincorp.com/), San Diego, CA, 
 worked on the projects related to the real-world mobile robotic applications deployed in Walmart and Sam's club. 

During my master's study I worked with Prof. Pratap Tokekar on using Reinforcement Learning in Multi-agent System research.
