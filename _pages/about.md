I am a **Master's student** in the **Computer Science** Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), 
 advised by Dr. Pratap Tokekar. My research intereses lie in solving real-world mobile robotics problems and reinforcement learning.
 
 During my master's study, I work as a **Research Assistant** at [The Robotics Algorithms & Autonomous Systems (RAAS) Lab, UMD](http://raaslab.org/index.html) with my advisor Dr. Pratap Tokekar. 
 I also worked as the Teaching Assistants for several CS classes from the introductory programming, data structure to the introduction of AI.   
 
 Besides working at the school, I did a summer internship as a **Robotics Software Engineer** at [Brain Corp](https://www.braincorp.com/), San Diego, CA, 
 worked on the projects related to the real-world mobile robotic applications deployed in Walmart and Sam's club.
