I"><p>I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I am working with <a href="https://robotics.umd.edu/clark/faculty/350/Yiannis-Aloimonos">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a>  and <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/">Cornelia Fermüller</a> at <a href="https://prg.cs.umd.edu/">Perception and Robotics Group</a>.  I also work closely with <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/">Prof. Christopher Metzler</a>.  During my master’s study I worked with <a href="http://tokekar.com/">Prof. Pratap Tokekar</a> on using Reinforcement Learning in Multi-agent System research. <br />
My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, imaging, and robotics, focusing on generative models,  neural representations for motion in videos, and 3D vision for robotics.</p>
