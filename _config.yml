# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
I am working with [Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos](https://robotics.umd.edu/clark/faculty/350/Yiannis-Aloimonos) and [Cornelia Ferm√ºller](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/) at [Perception and Robotics Group](https://prg.cs.umd.edu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Christopher Metzler](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/). 
During my master's study I worked with [Prof. Pratap Tokekar](http://tokekar.com/) on using Reinforcement Learning in Multi-agent System research. <br>

My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, imaging, and robotics, focusing on generative models, 
neural representations for motion in videos, and 3D vision for robotics.
